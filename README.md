# ConsoleMenuBuilder
 Class to easily build a console menu

## Short intro
I am totally new to C# and still learning a lot. Just started out using interfaces. But still no unit testing etc. used. The menu is quite clumpsy and not really perfect at all. I hope to be able to learn more about C# and what it is capable of in order to implement better solutions than the current one. 

I am absolutely open to any suggestions and tips on how to make this more effective. BUT I need to understand as to why the change is proposed - this is currently a pure learning tool for me to get better. So it doesn't help if I get suggestions I don't even understand. ;)
